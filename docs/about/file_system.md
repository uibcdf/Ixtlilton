# File system

## The global file system

| Mounted Volume | Size | Type |
| -------------- | ---- | ---- |
| / | 223 Gb | SSD |
| /home | 465.8 Gb | SSD |
| /HOT_DATA | 465.8 Gb | SSD |
| /DATA | 8.2 Tb | Raid 5 HDD |
| /COLD_STORAGE_ROOM | 11 Tb | Raid 5 HDD |


### ROOT

### HOME

There is an 466 Gbs SSD drive with a unique volume hosting the directory `/home`.
This place stores the home directory of every user. The writing/reading speed is fast, but the
memory limited here. In a first moment there will be no space quotas applied to each home
directory, but there will be be quotas if needed.

Users know that their own work directory must be used to store their scripts, docs, module environments, conda environments, github repos, small software and temporary light files for analysis

### DATA

DATA is a virtual raid 5 volume built with HDDs drives. This kind of drives have a slow
reading/writing speed, but this memory is cheap. Today this volume adds up to 8.2 Tbs, but will be
increased as soon as there is no room left to play its role.

Two directories are found in DATA: `/DATA/work` and `/DATA/projects` 

#### Work

The directory `/DATA/work` stores the work directory of every user. Users know that this folder is
used to store heavy, not shared with other users, and not frequently readed data or files during a
long term period. Once the project is finished all these files and data will be moved to the
COLD_STORAGE_ROOM for its indefinite storage.

#### Projects

There is in DATA a directory, `/DATA/projects`, where heavy and not frequently readed data should
be stored. These files, or data, have to be organised in folders with names evoking each project.
And every user participating in the project must have rights to use it. Files here have to be
accessible for every coworker to avoid duplicity of files. 

Users should not make multiple copies of what it is stored here, if not necessary. All users
analysing a common file should do it from here, not from their own copy. And, if fast access is
needed to the data, there is specific shared directory to temporary keep an accessible copy to every coworker
as well: `HOT_DATA/projects`.

## The user file system

The description of the user file system can be found in the section ['Instructions for users: File
system'](../user/user_file_system.md).
